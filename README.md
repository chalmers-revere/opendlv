## OpenDLV

OpenDLV is an open software environment intended to run in autonomous
self-driving vehicles. It runs on the vehicle itself and should handle hardware
communication, safety and override functions, sensor fusion, decision making,
and visualisation. It is written entirely in standard C++, and is formally
tested (unit tests and code coverage). Its focus is on code clarity, portability,
and performance.
