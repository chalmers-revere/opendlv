# If the managed level is pulse_shift, all connected modules will be informed
# about the supercomponent's real time by this increment per module. Thus, the
# execution times per modules are better aligned with supercomponent and the
# data exchange is somewhat more predictable.
odsupercomponent.pulseshift.shift = 10000 # (in microseconds)

# If the managed level is pulse_time_ack, this is the timeout for waiting for
# an ACK message from a connected client.
odsupercomponent.pulsetimeack.timeout = 5000 # (in milliseconds)

# If the managed level is pulse_time_ack, the modules are triggered sequentially
# by sending pulses and waiting for acknowledgment messages. To allow the modules
# to deliver their respective containers, this yielding time is used to sleep
# before supercomponent sends the pulse messages the next module in this execution
# cycle. This value needs to be adjusted for networked simulations to ensure
# deterministic execution. 
odsupercomponent.pulsetimeack.yield = 5000 # (in microseconds)
