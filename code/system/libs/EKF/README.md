# Kalman Filter Library

Forked from https://github.com/mherb/kalman 

This is a header-only C++11 library implementing common variants of the well-known [Kalman-Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter).
Currently implementations of these filter variants are included:

* Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)
* Square Root Extended Kalman Filter (SR-EKF)
* Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)
* Square Root Unscented Kalman Filter (SR-UKF)

## Dependencies

This library makes heavy use of the excellent [Eigen3 library](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) for linear algebra operations and is thus a required dependency.

## Usage
In order to use the library to do state estimation, a number of things have to be done:

1. Define a state-vector type
2. (Optional) Define a control-vector type
3. Define a system model
4. Define one (or more) measurement models with corresponding measurement vector types

### Example
A fairly worked out example on how to use the library is given in `examples/Robot1` with detailed commentary.

### State Vector
The state vector defines the state variables of your system that should be estimated.
You can use the readily available `Kalman::Vector` template type as your vector or derive your own specialized state vector from that.

### Control Vector
In case your system has some control input, a control vector has to be defined analogously to the state vector.

### System Model
The system model defines how the system state evolves over time, i.e. from one time-step to the next given some control input.
The transition function is in general non-linear. Any system model must derive from the base `SystemModel` class template.
In case a linearized filter such as the Extended Kalman Filter should be used, then the system model must be given as linearized model by deriving from `LinearizedSystemModel` and defining the corresponding jacobians.

Note that linearized models can of course also be used with fully non-linear filters such as the Unscented Kalman Filter.

### Measurement Vector
The measurement vector represents the measurement taken by some sensors and has to be defined analogously to the state and control vectors.

### Measurement Model
The measurement model defines how a measurement is related to the system state, i.e. it maps a system state to the expected sensor measurement.
Measurement models must derive from the class template `MeasurementModel` or, in case of linearized models for EKFs, from `LinearizedMeasurementModel`.

## FAQ

__The filters are running very slowly, why is that and how can I make them faster?__
By default, operations in Eigen include a lot of debug code, such as checking for valid matrix and vector bounds and so on.
To speed things up, these checks can be disabled using the pre-processor define

    -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG

which is also automatically set when using the general

    -DNDEBUG

flag. In addition to that the regular optimization flags including `-O2` will make things faster.
