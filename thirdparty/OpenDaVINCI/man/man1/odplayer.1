.SH NAME
odplayer \- This tool plays back data to a running OpenDaVINCI container conference session.



.SH SYNOPSIS
.B odplayer --cid=<CID> [OPTIONS]



.SH DESCRIPTION
odplayer belongs to OpenDaVINCI and is a tool to play back previously recorded
data exchanged to a running OpenDaVINCI container conference session.

The following parameters need to be present in the configuration file supplied by
odsupercomponent(1) to correctly configure odplayer:

.RS
.B global.buffer.memorySegmentSize = 1000000

.B global.buffer.numberOfMemorySegments = 20

.B player.remoteControl = 0

.B player.input = file://myRecording.rec

.B player.timeScale = 1.0

.B player.autoRewind = 0
.RE

The parameter 'global.buffer.memorySegementSize' defines the size of buffer segment
that is used to replay data from captured images temporarily for example; typical values
are 921600 bytes corresponding to a VGA full-color image.

odplayer will allocate the number segments as specified in the parameter 'global.buffer.numberOfMemorySegments'
in total during the playback process.

The parameter 'player.remoteControl' has no effect during interactive use of odplayer.

The parameter 'player.input' defines the filename containing the recorded data to be played back.

The parameter 'player.timeScale' specifies whether the recorded containers shall be played
back faster or slower than originally recorded.

The parameter 'player.autoRewind' specifies whether the recording file shall be rewind
at EOF and replayed again.

This tool can only be used within an existing OpenDaVINCI container conference session
created by odsupercomponent(1).



.SH OPTIONS
.B --cid=<CID>
.RS
This parameter specifies the conference identifier (CID) that is used to join a
running container conference session. The session itself needs to be created by
odsupercomponent(1).
.RE


.B --freq=<FREQ>
.RS
This parameter specifies the runtime frequency in Hz that is used to run odplayer.
If this parameter is omitted, a runtime frequency of 1 Hz is used.

Please note that a too low frequency would result in bursts of played back
containers. Thus, it is advised to set '--freq' to a sufficiently high value.
.RE


.B --realtime=<0..49>
.RS
This parameter will schedule odplayer to use the SCHED_FIFO soft realtime
scheduler. The parameter specifies the scheduling priority.

Please note that this feature is only available on Linux-based systems having a
CONFIG_PREEMPT_RT kernel. In addition, odplayer needs to be executed with
superuser privileges.

This parameter has no effect if odsupercomponent(1) is started using the
parameter '--managed'.
.RE


.B --verbose=<0..10>
.RS
This parameter specifies the verbosity level that is used to print some information to stdlog.
.RE



.SH EXAMPLES
The following command plays back the exchanged data to an OpenDaVINCI container
conference session using a frequency of 10 Hz.

.B odplayer --cid=111 --freq=10
